# User Story: Leo (The Rescuer)

**Role:** Volunteer Responder
**Tool:** ResQLink Rescuer Portal

### The Problem
In previous disasters, Leo spent hours waiting for orders from a centralized headquarters that was overwhelmed and out of touch with the ground reality.

### The ResQLink Experience
1. **Grab-Style Dispatch:** Leo opens his dashboard. He sees a heat map of active SOS reports.
2. **Self-Assignment:** He sees "Maya's SOS" - Priority: CRITICAL (Rising Water). It's 2 minutes away from his current location.
3. **Seamless Navigation:** He taps "Accept." The app provides a mesh-calculated route avoiding blocked roads (reported by other users).
4. **Real-Time Intel:** He sees the photo Maya took. He knows he needs a boat, not just a truck.

### Result
Leo reaches Maya in 12 minutes. He marks the incident as "Resolved," and the data instantly updates the LGU's Command Center.
