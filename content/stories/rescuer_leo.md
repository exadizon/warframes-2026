# User Story: Leo (The Rescuer)

**Role:** Volunteer Multi-Hazard Responder
**Tool:** ResQLink Rescuer Portal

### The Problem
In previous disasters, Leo struggled with fragmented information. He didn't know which agency was handling what, or where the most critical needs were in real-time.

### The ResQLink Experience (The "How")
1. **Unified Command:** Leo opens his dashboard and sees a "Unified Front." He can see fire alerts, flood zones, and seismic damage all in one view.
2. **AI-Prioritized Dispatch:** He doesn't just see a list; he sees a prioritized "Mission Map." The AI has already flagged "Maya's SOS" as CRITICAL.
3. **Adaptive Logistics:** The app provides a route based on the disaster type (e.g., avoiding flooded streets or unstable structures).
4. **Cross-Agency Sync:** He can see that a fire truck is already 5 minutes away, so he focuses on the search-and-rescue mission.

### Result
Leo reaches Maya in 12 minutes. His successful mission is recorded, and the data instantly updates the LGU's Command Center, proving the effectiveness of community-led resilience.
