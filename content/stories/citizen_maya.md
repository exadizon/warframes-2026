# User Story: Maya (The Citizen)

**Scenario:** Any Crisis (Typhoon, Urban Fire, or Earthquake). Power is out, and cellular towers are down.
**Location:** Barangay San Antonio, Philippines.

### The Problem
Maya is in a vulnerable situation (trapped by rising water, blocked by fire debris, or isolated after a tremor). She opens her phone, but there is "No Service." She needs to know she hasn't been forgotten.

### The ResQLink Experience (The "Why")
1. **Universal Connectivity:** ResQLink automatically switches to **BLE Mesh Mode**. Whether it's a flood or a fire, her phone finds a neighbor's device.
2. **Multi-Hazard SOS:** She selects the specific emergency (e.g., "Life-Threatening Fire" or "Trapped in Debris").
3. **AI Triage:** Even offline, the local AI analyzes her situation (photo or voice memo) and tags it with high-priority metadata.
4. **Peace of Mind:** The app shows "Signal Received by Community Mesh." This is the core "Why"—the psychological safety of being connected when the grid fails.

### Result
Maya's report reaches a local responder (Leo) who is specialized in the specific hazard. Her 12-minute mission to safety begins.
