# User Story: Maya (The Citizen)

**Scenario:** Super Typhoon "Odette II" hits. Power is out, and cellular towers are down.
**Location:** Barangay San Antonio, Philippines.

### The Problem
Maya is trapped on the second floor of her home with her elderly grandmother. The water is rising. She opens her phone, but there is "No Service."

### The ResQLink Experience
1. **Offline Connectivity:** ResQLink automatically switches to **BLE Mesh Mode**. Her phone connects to her neighbor's phone, which is connected to a nearby community beacon.
2. **Instant SOS:** She taps the "Life-Threatening" button. She takes a photo of the rising water.
3. **AI Triage:** Even offline, the local AI model on her device compresses the image and attaches GPS metadata.
4. **Peace of Mind:** The app shows "Report Received by Nearby Mesh Node." She knows her cry for help is moving through the network.

### Result
Maya's report reaches a rescue boat 500 meters away. They weren't even looking in her street until the SOS popped up on their "Grab-style" map.
