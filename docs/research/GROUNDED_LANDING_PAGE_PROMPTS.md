## 🧩 Section-Specific "Grounded" Prompts

### 1. The Hero: Professional Authority
> **Prompt:** A desktop hero section for a flood prediction website. Background is a clean, realistic 3D satellite map of a city with a soft orange "risk area" highlight. Headline is "PROACTIVE PROTECTION." A primary button in solid Emergency Orange says "Get Early Alerts." The navigation is clean and white with "How it Works," "Community," and "Sign In."

### 2. The Logic: Human-Centric Connectivity
> **Prompt:** A minimalist landing page section explaining "Mesh Networking." Use three high-quality 3D icons (Phone, House, Rescue Boat). Connect them with soft, pulsing orange lines.

### 3. The Dashboard: Grounded Product View
> **Prompt:** A professional desktop dashboard UI for local government units. It looks like a high-end SaaS platform (similar to Stripe or Slack). Left sidebar for navigation. Main area is a clear, high-contrast map of a city with orange "Alert" dots. A side panel shows "Active Rescuers" with real names and photos. No "hacker" elements—just clean, actionable data.

### 4. The Impact: Simple Success Metrics
> **Prompt:** A clean, white section with three large, black numbers: "4 HOURS" (Early Warning), "100%" (Mesh Connectivity), "40% FASTER" (Response Time). Below each number is a single sentence of simple, realistic explanation.
