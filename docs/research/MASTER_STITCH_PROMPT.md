# ResQLink: The "Feature-Deep" Master Stitch Prompt

This prompt is engineered for **Google Stitch** to generate a high-fidelity prototype landing page. It prioritizes **explicit feature explanation** over simple linking, ensuring the user understands the "How" and "Why" of the ResQLink SaaS platform within a single-page view.

## 🚀 The Feature-Deep Master Prompt

> **Prompt:** A high-fidelity, comprehensive desktop landing page for "ResQLink." 
> **Aesthetic:** "Light-Themed Cyberpunk" / Technical SaaS. Background: #FBFBFB (Soft Alabaster). Accents: Emergency Orange (#FF4500). Borders: 1px Slate Gray (#1A1C1E).
> **Typography:** High-contrast Serif (Headlines) and JetBrains Mono (Technical Explanations).
> 
> **Layout Structure (Explaining the System):**
> 1. **Hero (Value Prop):** A desaturated 3D city terrain. Serif Headline: "ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIVES DEPEND ON IT." A Monospace "System Status" box explicitly explains: "ResQLink is a multi-hazard coordination platform that uses AI to triage reports and BLE Mesh to connect the disconnected."
> 
> 2. **The Intelligence Engine (Detailed Feature):** A large 3-column bento grid that explains the AI Triage process step-by-step:
>    - **Column 1: [01 SUBMISSION]** "Captures GPS, photo evidence, and sensor data locally. Works without an internet connection using edge-processing."
>    - **Column 2: [02 SUMMARIZATION]** "AI processes raw data into 1-sentence briefings. Interprets visual damage and prioritizes life-threats in milliseconds."
>    - **Column 3: [03 RERANKING]** "Dynamic prioritization based on resource proximity. Matches the nearest specialized team (Boat, Fire, Medical) to the critical SOS."
> 
> 3. **The Bayanihan Mesh (Deep-Dive):** A full-width section with a technical diagram. Copy explicitly explains: "COMMUNICATION WITHOUT TOWERS. When cellular grids fail, ResQLink creates a temporary bridge using Bluetooth Low Energy. Every phone in the community acts as a 'node,' hopping your SOS signal from device to device until it reaches a responder gateway."
> 
> 4. **Three-Tier Coordination (Platform Features):**
>    - **Citizen Portal:** "One-tap reporting with offline status tracking. See when help is on the way even if you are off-grid."
>    - **Rescuer Dashboard:** "Self-assignment system for volunteers. View real-time GPS heatmaps and accept missions based on your expertise."
>    - **LGU Command Center:** "The 'Big Picture.' A unified dashboard to coordinate multi-agency assets (Police, Fire, NGO) and track resource depletion levels."
> 
> 5. **Impact & SDG Integration:** Large hollow Serif numbers ("1.2M PROTECTED") with Monospace logs: "Directly contributes to UN SDG 11 by reducing disaster-related deaths and SDG 13 by strengthening climate-related adaptive capacity."
> 
> 6. **Footer:** Professional 1px border layout with technical support logs and partnership links.
> 
> **Vibe:** Precise, architectural, and educational. The page should feel like a 'Technical Briefing' that leaves the user with a total understanding of the platform's mechanics. 1440px width.

## 🛠️ Usage Instructions
1. This prompt is designed to fill the "information gap" of a single-page prototype.
2. Use it in **Google Stitch** to generate a layout that is content-dense and explanatory.
3. If the generated text is too short, use the sub-prompts in `docs/research/STITCH_PROMPTS.md` to expand specific sections with the verbatim copy from `docs/research/RESQLINK_ORG_CONTENT.md`.
