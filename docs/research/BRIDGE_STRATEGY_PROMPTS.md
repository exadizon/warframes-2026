## 1. The "Flood Prediction" Hero (Desktop)
**Goal:** Bridge the current ResQLink mission with the 2026 Flood Case Study.
> **Prompt:** A high-end desktop landing page hero section. Background is a deep void black. The left side features a vertical, minimalist "Current Status" sidebar showing live barometric data in JetBrains Mono. The center stage is a 3D glass-textured terrain map of the Philippines. A glowing safety orange (#FF5F1F) heat-map overlay shows "Predicted Flood Zones." Large, bold typography in Space Grotesk reads: "RESQLINK: FORECASTING THE SURGE." Below it, a subtle "Production Version" badge links to the main site.

## 2. The "Intelligence Engine" Split-View (Desktop)
**Goal:** Show the transition from Maya’s human story to raw AI data.
> **Prompt:** A desktop scrollytelling section with a 60/40 split. 
> - **Left Side (The Story):** A cinematic, high-contrast dark image of a citizen using a phone in a rainstorm. A text overlay says "MAYA: OFFLINE BUT CONNECTED." 
> - **Right Side (The Raw Data):** A transparent glassmorphism panel showing the AI's backend logic. Include a "Raw Signal Feed" box with scrolling code, and a "Mesh Path Visualization" showing a line connecting "User_Maya" to "LGU_Gateway_Node." Use Cyan (#00F5FF) for data lines.

## 3. The "Product Bridge" Command Center (Desktop)
**Goal:** Promote the "Eventual Product" (The actual portal) using AWWWARDS aesthetics.
> **Prompt:** A sophisticated desktop dashboard mockup for a Disaster Command Center. This is the 'ResQLink Pro' interface. 
> - **Top Bar:** Global stats (Active SOS, Rescuers Online, Mesh Health). 
> - **Main View:** A bento-grid layout. The largest tile is an interactive 3D map with pulsing SOS markers. 
> - **Action Tile:** A "Grab-Style" dispatch card showing "Rescuer Leo" moving toward a mission. 
> - **Product Promotion:** A bottom banner stating "Deployed in 12 Municipalities. Integrating AI Prediction for 2026." Use a mix of frosted glass effects and heavy typography.

## 4. The "Global Resilience" Vision (Desktop)
**Goal:** Show the scale and future of the ResQLink product.
> **Prompt:** A minimalist desktop section featuring a 3D glowing wireframe globe. Points of light pulse across Southeast Asia. Massive numerical data points (e.g., "1.2M LIVES," "40% FASTER") are rendered in a hollow, outlined font that fills with Safety Orange as you scroll. The footer is a professional "Global Resilience Network" sign-up, mirroring the current resqlink.org waitlist but with a futuristic UI polish.

## 💡 Stitch Iteration Tips
- **To add "Warframe" vibe:** If a generation looks too "clean," add: *"Add mechanical UI elements, hexagonal patterns, and lens flare accents."*
- **To add "Real Data" vibe:** If a generation looks too "artistic," add: *"Incorporate technical schematics, coordinate grids, and timestamped log entries in a monospaced font."*
- **To ensure "Desktop" focus:** Always specify *"Wide aspect ratio, desktop browser view, 1440px width."*
