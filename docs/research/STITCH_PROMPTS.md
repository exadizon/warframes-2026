## 1. Hero Section: The Prediction (Desktop)
**Prompt:**
> A high-fidelity landing page hero section for a desktop browser. Background is a deep void black (#0A0A0B). The central focus is a large, immersive 3D topographic map of a coastal city with a translucent blue "water level" overlay that pulses to show flood risk. Typography is oversized, bold Space Grotesk: "FORECASTING FLOOD RISKS" in off-white (#F8F9FA). A primary call-to-action button in Safety Orange (#FF5F1F) says "EXPLORE REAL-TIME DATA" with a subtle outer glow. The navigation bar is a minimalist glassmorphism strip at the top with "AI Engine," "Command Center," and "Impact" links in JetBrains Mono font.

## 2. The Engine: AI/ML Bento Grid (Desktop)
**Prompt:**
> A sophisticated desktop landing page section featuring a large bento-box grid layout (3 columns, 2 rows). Theme is dark futuristic with 1px borders in low-opacity silver.
> - **Slot 1 (Top Left, 2x1):** A live-updating line chart visualizing "Soil Moisture vs. Precipitation" using Cyan (#00F5FF) and Orange (#FF5F1F) neon lines.
> - **Slot 2 (Top Right, 1x1):** A radial gauge showing "AI Confidence Index: 98.4%" with a liquid-fill animation.
> - **Slot 3 (Bottom Left, 1x1):** A "Satellite Status" card showing a high-res orbital view of a typhoon eye.
> - **Slot 4 (Bottom Center, 1x1):** A list of "Incoming Sensor Feeds" with scrolling code-like text in JetBrains Mono.
> - **Slot 5 (Bottom Right, 1x1):** A large "Current Alert Level" block in solid Safety Orange with a black exclamation icon.

## 3. Command Center: Multi-Agency Dashboard (Desktop)
**Prompt:**
> A complex, data-dense desktop dashboard view for a disaster response unit. The layout is divided into a 70/30 split. The left side is a full-screen interactive GPS heatmap with pulsing SOS icons. The right sidebar is a frosted glass panel containing a "Resource Allocation" list. Each list item shows a rescuer's name, their distance from a critical SOS (e.g., "Leo - 250m away"), and a "Dispatch AI" button. The top header shows global metrics: "Active SOS: 12," "Rescuers Deployed: 45," and "Mesh Network Health: 100%." Style is high-contrast dark mode with heavy use of transparency and blur.

## 4. Narrative: The "Maya" Scrollytelling Section (Desktop)
**Prompt:**
> A cinematic desktop section with a split-screen layout. On the left, a high-contrast black-and-white photograph of a flood-prone neighborhood. On the right, a clean, minimal text block that fades in: "MEET MAYA. WHEN THE GRID FAILED, RESQLINK DIDN'T." Beneath the text, a diagram shows a mobile phone connecting to a neighbor's phone via a glowing cyan mesh line, bypassing a crossed-out cellular tower. The transition between text segments is triggered by scrolling, with background elements moving in a subtle parallax effect.

## 5. Impact: Global Resilience Metrics (Desktop)
**Prompt:**
> A minimalist desktop section featuring three massive data points.
> 1. "**1.2M+ LIVES PROTECTED**" in outlined typography that fills with color as the user scrolls.
> 2. "**40% FASTER RESPONSE**" with a small animated infographic of a clock speeding up.
> 3. "**100% OFFLINE UPTIME**" with a visualization of a resilient BLE mesh grid covering a globe.
> The background uses a subtle grainy texture with a deep orange radial gradient in the bottom corner to add depth. Final footer is a clean, single-line menu with social links and a "Join the Waitlist" input field.
