# Landing Page Master Guide: ResQLink (Warframes 2026 Edition)

## 1. Core Mission Alignment
Based on the **Case Study: Forecasting Flood Risks**, the landing page must showcase:
- **AI/ML for Prediction:** How ResQLink uses data to forecast floods *before* they happen.
- **Actionable Information:** Clear UI for citizens to prepare.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive maps and risk heatmaps.

## 2. Visual Identity & Style Guide
**Goal:** Futuristic, urgent yet calming, and highly professional (AWWWARDS level).

### Color Palette
- **Deep Void (#0A0A0B):** Background.
- **Flood Warning Orange (#FF5F1F):** Primary Action & Alerts.
- **Data Cyan (#00F5FF):** AI/ML pathways and technical data.
- **Neutral Silver (#E0E0E0):** Typography and UI borders.

### Typography
- **Heading:** *Inter Tight* or *Space Grotesk* (Bold, high tracking).
- **Body:** *JetBrains Mono* (for data points) and *Plus Jakarta Sans* (for readability).

| **The AI Engine** | "Processing 1TB of weather data per second." | A bento grid showing real-time metrics (Barometric pressure, Soil moisture). |
| **The Preparation** | "Personalized Survival Protocols." | A "Citizen Dashboard" mockup that changes based on the flood risk level. |
| **The Mesh Network** | "Connectivity in the Eye of the Storm." | Visualizing BLE Mesh nodes connecting as traditional towers "fade out." |
