# ResQLink: Narrative Architecture (The Multi-Hazard Experience)

**Theme:** All-Hazard Resilience | **Style:** Interactive Scrollytelling | **Focus:** 60% Story / 40% Features

---

## Section 1: The Multi-Hazard Horizon (The Hero)
**Goal:** Establish authority across all disasters (Typhoon, Fire, Earthquake).
- **Interactive Trigger:** A "Hazard Selector" dial. Users can toggle between "The Surge" (Flood), "The Heat" (Fire), or "The Shift" (Earthquake).
- **Data Overlay:** Real-time predictive metrics that change based on the selected hazard (e.g., Wind Speed, Heat Signature, Seismic Intensity).
- **Visual:** A 3D topographic city map. When a hazard is selected, the city morphs—blue liquid flows for floods, orange embers for fire, or wireframe fractures for earthquakes.
- **Copy:** "Minutes Matter. No Matter the Disaster."

## Section 2: The Universal Signal (The Human Story)
**Goal:** Connect the technology to the "Why"—saving a human life like **Maya**.
- **Story:** Maya isn't just a flood victim; she is the face of "The Disconnected." 
- **Data Integration:** "Signal: 0% | Power: 0% | BLE Mesh: SEARCHING."
- **Visual:** A cinematic split-view. On one side, the raw environmental chaos. On the other, Maya's calm phone interface showing "Mesh Active. Neighbor Found."
- **Copy:** "For Maya, technology isn't about features. It's about being seen when everything else goes dark."

## Section 3: The Intelligence Engine (How It Works)
**Goal:** Show the AI/ML features as the "Invisible Guardian."
- **Visual:** A **Bento Grid** that visualizes the "Digital Triage."
- **Data Blocks (Feature 40%):**
    - **Edge AI Analysis:** A video frame showing a photo of debris being tagged: `[Hazard: Structural_Collapse, Priority: 1, Recommendation: K9_Unit]`.
    - **Offline Pathfinding:** A map of the city showing how an SOS "hops" through a community mesh network.
    - **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Scrolling logs of barometric, seismic, and thermal data being processed locally.
- **Copy:** "Intelligence that doesn't need the Cloud. Smart enough to triage the chaos on the edge."

## Section 4: The Unified Command (Leo's Mission)
**Goal:** Show the "Product" (Rescuer/LGU Portal) as the tool for resolution.
- **Visual:** The "Command Center" dashboard. Sleek, dark, and professional.
- **Story Integration:** **Leo (The Rescuer)** receives Maya's alert. The UI shows his specific vehicle (Boat, Truck, or Heli) and his "Time to Rescue."
- **Product Features (Feature 40%):**
    - **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Showing 10,000+ reports being re-ranked in real-time.
    - **Cross-Agency Dispatch:** A button that syncs Fire, Police, and Medical units.
- **Copy:** "Unified Intelligence. One platform to coordinate 10,000 heroes."

## Section 5: The Global Blueprint (The Future)
**Goal:** Scale the narrative to a global movement.
- **Visual:** The 3D city zooms out to a pulsing Global Mesh Network.
- **Data Integration:** "Active Nodes: 1.2M | Lives Impacted: 4.5M."
- **Call to Action (CTA):** "Build a Resilient Future. Join the Network."
- **Copy:** "Disasters are global. Resilience is local. ResQLink is the new standard for a safer world."

## 🛠️ Design Execution Notes for Figma
1. **Interactive Dial:** Use a radial selector in the Hero to trigger "State Changes" across the entire page (Color theme shifts: Blue for Flood, Red for Fire, Green for Earthquake).
2. **Typography:** **Space Grotesk** for technical data (The "How") and **Plus Jakarta Sans** for the narrative (The "Why").
3. **The "Pulse" Path:** A Cyan line that represents the SOS signal "traveling" from Maya's device through the sections until it reaches Leo's dashboard.
