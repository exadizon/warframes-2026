# ResQLink: Narrative Architecture (The Desktop Experience)

**Theme:** Forecasting Flood Risks | **Style:** Immersive Scrollytelling | **Focus:** Data + Story + Product

---

## Section 1: The Predictive Horizon (The Hero)
**Goal:** Establish immediate authority on the "Forecasting" theme.
- **Story:** Start with silence. The calm before the storm.
- **Data Overlay:** A "Probability of Inundation" ticker (e.g., "87% confidence of 1.2m surge in 4 hours").
- **Visual:** A 3D wireframe terrain of a city. As the user scrolls, a "digital flood" (blue glow) slowly rises, highlighting "High Risk" bento-boxes over specific neighborhoods.
- **Copy:** "Predicting the Surge. Protecting the Soul."

## Section 2: The Human Signal (The Transition)
**Goal:** Connect the raw data to a real human life.
- **Story:** Meet **Maya**. Her icon appears on the 3D map we just saw.
- **Data Integration:** A small side-panel shows Maya’s device status: "Battery: 14% | Signal: 0% | BLE Mesh: ACTIVE."
- **Visual:** The screen splits. Left side stays on the 3D map; right side shows a blurred, high-contrast photo of Maya's neighborhood.
- **Copy:** "For Maya, 87% probability isn't a statistic. It's the time she has left to move her grandmother."

## Section 3: The Intelligence Engine (The "How It Works")
**Goal:** Show off the AI/ML technical depth required by the case study.
- **Visual:** A massive **Bento Grid** that "explodes" out of Maya's phone.
- **Raw Data Blocks:**
    - **Live Sensor Feed:** Scrollable JSON-style text of barometric pressure and soil saturation.
    - **AI Triage Logic:** A flowchart showing how Maya's photo is tagged by AI: `[Water_Level: 0.8m, Priority: Critical, Rescue_Type: Boat]`.
    - **Network Health:** A visualization of the mesh network bypassing dead cellular towers.
- **Copy:** "Intelligence that lives on the edge. No cloud. No towers. Just ResQLink."

## Section 4: The Command Center (The Product Reveal)
**Goal:** Promote the "eventual" product (The LGU/Rescuer Portal).
- **Visual:** A full-width "Command Center" dashboard mockup. It’s dark, sleek, and interactive.
- **Data Integration:** We see **Leo (The Rescuer)** accepting Maya's SOS.
- **Product Features:**
    - **Grab-Style Dispatch:** "Rescuer Leo is 4 mins away."
    - **Dynamic Reranking:** AI re-prioritizing 500+ reports in real-time.
    - **Resource Allocation:** A "Bento Box" showing boat vs. truck deployment stats.
- **Copy:** "A Unified Front. One dashboard to coordinate 10,000 heroes."

## Section 5: The Global Blueprint (The Future)
**Goal:** Promote the vision and scale of the product.
- **Visual:** The 3D city map zooms out to a 3D globe. Pulse points appear across Southeast Asia and other disaster-prone zones.
- **Data Integration:** "Lives Saved Counter" (Animated incrementing numbers).
- **Call to Action (CTA):** A "Join the Global Resilience Network" waitlist form.
- **Copy:** "ResQLink isn't just an app; it's the new standard for community resilience. From one neighborhood to the whole world."

## 🛠️ Design Execution Notes for Figma
1. **The Scroll-Trigger:** Use Figma's "Smart Animate" on scroll to move the 3D terrain.
2. **Typography Contrast:** Use **Space Grotesk** for the "Hero/Data" and **Plus Jakarta Sans** for "Maya's Story" to create a distinct feel between tech and human.
3. **The "Glow" Path:** Use a Cyan line (#00F5FF) that "travels" down the page as the user scrolls, connecting the Prediction -> Maya -> The Engine -> Leo -> The World.
