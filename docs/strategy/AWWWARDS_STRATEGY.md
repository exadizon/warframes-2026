# ResQLink: Warframes 2026 Strategy (The "Light Cyber" SaaS Edition)

## 1. Vision: "The Mission-Critical Authority"
To win a UI/UX competition like Warframes, we must demonstrate **Technical Authority** and **Measurable Impact**. Our approach moves beyond simple scrollytelling into **Mission-Based UX**—a high-end SaaS-first strategy that projects reliability and specialized performance.

### Design Principles (The "Light Cyber" Aesthetic)
- **High-Contrast Typography:** Pair an authoritative **Serif** (e.g., *DM Serif Display*) for grounded headlines with a precise **Monospace** (e.g., *JetBrains Mono*) for technical UI labels.
- **Light Cyber Look:** Move away from dark-mode "cyberpunk" tropes. Use a **#FBFBFB (Soft Alabaster)** background with **1px Slate Gray (#1A1C1E)** borders and **Emergency Orange (#FF4500)** as the sole functional accent.
- **Architectural Bento Grids:** Structure complex features (AI Triage, BLE Mesh) in a modular, data-dense, and highly scannable grid layout.
- **3D Topographic Data Viz:** Use desaturated 3D city maps with orange risk overlays to provide actionable technical context.

## 2. Content Structure (SaaS-First Mission)

### I. The Hero: Technical Authority
- **Visual:** A desaturated 3D satellite view of the Philippines with a 1px technical grid.
- **Copy:** "ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIVES DEPEND ON IT."
- **UX Goal:** Immediate technical authority. Show real-time GPS coordinates and mesh status logs.

### II. The Engine: AI Triage & Mesh Logic
- **Visual:** A 3-column architectural bento grid.
- **Feature A:** The AI Triage Engine (Submission → Summarization → Reranking).
- **Feature B:** The Bayanihan Mesh (Device-to-device connectivity paths).
- **Feature C:** Grab-Style Dispatch (Rescuer Leo's 250m mission proximity).

### III. The Product: Unified Command Center
- **Visual:** A professional, high-contrast dashboard mockup for LGU and Rescue agencies.
- **UX Goal:** Show the SaaS platform as a mission-critical tool for multi-agency coordination.

### IV. Measurable Impact: The "Why"
- **KPIs:** "1.2M LIVES SAVED," "40% FASTER RESPONSE."
- **SDG Alignment:** Explicitly connect technical features to UN Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities) and 13 (Climate Action).
